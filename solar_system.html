    <h2>Solar System</h2>
    <p>The Solar System is made up of the Sun and all of the smaller objects that move around it. Apart from the Sun, the largest members of the Solar System are the eight major planets. Nearest the Sun are four fairly small, rocky planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.

        <br>
        <br>
        Beyond Mars is the asteroid belt – a region populated by millions of rocky objects. These are left-overs from the formation of the planets, 4.5 billion years ago.

    </p>


    <h3>Mercury</h3>
    <p>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun. It is not very easy to observe since it is always close to the Sun in the sky. Even when best placed, it is close to the horizon and only visible for a few hours after sunset or before sunrise.
        Named after the winged messenger of the gods, the planet speeds around the Sun once every 88 days. However, it spins on its axis very slowly – once every 58.6 days. This is exactly two thirds of its orbital period.</p>

    <h3>Venus</h3>
    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, so it is always fairly close to the Sun in the sky. It appears as a brilliant morning or evening “star” – the brightest object in the night sky apart from the Moon. In a telescope, it can be seen to go through phases, just like the Moon.
        Venus is so bright because it is covered by clouds that reflect much of the incoming sunlight. The yellowish clouds are made of sulphur and sulphuric acid.
        In some ways, Venus is Earth’s twin. It is about the same size and made of the same rocky materials. It also comes closer to us than any other planet. However, it is blanketed with a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide – the gas that we breathe out. This atmosphere is so dense that walking through would be like wading through water.</p>


    <h3>Earth- the traveller in space</h3>
    <p>Everyone on Earth is a traveller through space. First, the Earth zooms around the Sun at a speed of 30 km/s – 45 times faster than Concorde. It takes 365 days (one year) to complete one orbit of the Sun.
        It also spins very quickly, like a top that is leaning to one side. People living at the equator travel from west to east at a speed of 1670 km per hour. (The speed is slower for people living near the poles). Since everything around us is moving in the same way, we do not usually notice our high speed journey. The most obvious way to tell is to watch the Sun, Moon and stars as they appear to move across the sky.</p>

    <h3>Mars-the red planet</h3>
    <p>Mars is often called the 'Red Planet' because it appears in the sky as an orange-red star. The colour caused the ancient Greeks and Romans to name it after their god of war. Today, thanks to visiting spacecraft, we know that the planet's appearance is due to rust in the Martian rocks.
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It orbits the Sun at an average distance of 228 million km, half as far again as the Earth, so human visitors would find it very cold. Although summers near the equator can be quite warm, the average temperature is 63 degrees Celsius below zero - similar to winters in Antarctica. The nights are also bitterly cold.</p>

    <h3>Jupiter</h3>
    <p>Beyond the asteroid belt is Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun. Everything about Jupiter is large. It is so big that it could easily swallow all of the other planets (or more than 1,300 Earths). It also weighs more than twice as much as all the other planets. Despite its huge size, Jupiter is the fastest-spinning planet, rotating once in less than 10 hours.</p>

    <h3>Saturn</h3>
    <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun. It was thought to be the furthest of the planets until the telescope was invented.
        Second only in size to Jupiter, Saturn is made mainly of the light gases hydrogen and helium. 764 Earths would fit inside Saturn, but the gas giant weighs only 95 times as much as our rocky world. If you could put all of the planets in a pool of water, Saturn is the only one that would float.</p>

    <h3>Neptune</h3>
    <p>Neptune was discovered in 1846 by Johann Galle, an astronomer at the Berlin Observatory. Galle knew where to look because of calculations by French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier. Both Le Verrier and John Adams in England had realised that an unseen planet was pulling on Uranus, causing it to slow down or speed up.</p>

    <h3>Uranus</h3>
    <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1781.
        Uranus lies more than 2,800 million km from the Sun. At this distance, the temperature of its cloud tops is -214 degrees C. It moves quite slowly and has a long way to travel, so each orbit lasts 84 years.</p>



    <h3>Pluto</h3>
    <p>Pluto was discovered in 1930 by 24 year-old Clyde Tombaugh, who was using a special machine to compare photos of the sky. It turned out to be a tiny world, even smaller than our Moon.
        Pluto follows an elliptical (egg-shaped) orbit that varies between 7,381 million km (49 Sun-Earth distances) and 4,446 million km (30 Sun-Earth distances). Since one orbit lasts 248 years, no one born on Pluto would ever experience a single birthday!</p>
